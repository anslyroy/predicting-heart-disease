# Predicting Heart Disease at Early Stages

A machine learning-based academic project aimed at predicting heart disease in its early stages, helping individuals take preventive action before the condition becomes critical.

---

## Abstract

Predicting and detecting heart disease has always been a critical and challenging task for healthcare practitioners. Hospitals and clinics often offer expensive treatments and surgeries, making early prediction an essential need for people globally. Heart disease is increasingly common due to lifestyle factors such as alcohol, tobacco usage, and lack of exercise.

This project leverages supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical and lifestyle data. The models used include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Their performance metrics are analyzed and compared.
